# Compatibility

vkxp aims at the behaviour of the original runtime of RPG Maker XP, RGSS 1.04. Games that
use the default scripts or common community scripts are meant to run unmodified.

## What is exact

Frames are compared with those of the original runtime, which
[`cargo xtask oracle`](development.md#comparing-with-the-original-runtime) runs under Wine
beside vkxp, with the same input and the same seed. On the seven community-made games that
serve as the regression corpus, the frames compared are pixel-identical except for text
glyphs, whose rasterisation differs from that of Windows GDI.

Many rules were measured on the original runtime rather than taken from a description of it:
the arithmetic of the bitmap operations and of blending, the layout of text, the timing of
frames and more. The specifications under [`openspec/specs`](../openspec/specs) record them,
and `vkxp-pixel` lists for each of its functions whether its formula was measured.

The CPU reference compositor and the Vulkan backend must produce byte-identical frames; the
tests render every message stream with both.

## Known differences

Behaviour that is not yet checked against the original runtime is marked `PLACEHOLDER` in the
source. What remains under `crates/`:

- **Text metrics.** The original runtime was measured under Wine, so a few rules are those of
  Wine's GDI and may not be those of Windows: the choice of the pixels per em for a size, the
  rounding when text is squeezed into a narrow rectangle, and the strength of a synthesised
  bold and the slant of a synthesised italic. Most built-in line boxes of the Windows fonts
  are from memory of their metric tables.
- **Text glyphs.** Glyphs are not rasterised as Windows GDI rasterises them, so the pixels of
  text differ while its layout and advance widths are kept. A character the selected font
  lacks is drawn from another font; the original, measured under Wine, draws the missing
  glyph.
- **Win32API shims.** The toggle bits that `GetKeyState` and `GetKeyboardState` report
  start at 0: the lock keys of the machine start off, whatever their state is.
  `mouse_event` presses and releases buttons but does not move the pointer or turn the
  wheel. A key injected with `keybd_event` or `mouse_event` is seen one `Input.update`
  later than on Windows when a script injects and updates in the same frame. These rules
  and those of `ShowCursor` and `SetKeyboardState` follow the documentation of Windows and
  were not measured on the original.

The level of a transition mask pixel follows the original's rule, which was measured with PNG
masks of 24 and 32 bits; masks with a palette, in grey of 8 or 16 bits, and JPEG masks were
not measured.

Besides these, WMA sounds are decoded by the `ffmpeg` program, which has to be installed:
without it they stay silent. vkxp runs on Linux, and x86_64 is the supported architecture;
the job `gate-aarch64` of the [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) shows what works on
aarch64.

## Limits of save states

Save states are described under [Save states](running.md#save-states). Their limits:

- States live in memory and end with the run. Nothing is written to disk.
- Files the game wrote after a state was saved stay as they are, its own saves included; a
  file a script holds open across frames shares its position with the copies.
- Each state costs the memory pages the game has changed since it was saved.
- States need the guest in a process, and no state is saved with
  `--allow-process-functions`.
- The keys only show a notice while input is recorded or replayed.
